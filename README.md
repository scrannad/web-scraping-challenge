# Web Scraping Challenge
In this challenge, I scrape and analyze Mars information and data utilizing Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and matplotlib.

The first deliverable, mars_news, uses BeautifulSoup to extract html and scrape titles and preview text from a Mars News site.

The second deliverable, mars_weather, extracts a Mars temperature table containing data from the Mars rover, Curiosity. I then converted this into a Pandas DataFrame and analyzed the weather data to answer the following questions:
- How many months exist on Mars?
- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.

The DataFrame is then exported to a CSV file.
